What Is XHTML?
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
XHTML is almost identical to HTML
XHTML is stricter than HTML
XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
XHTML is supported by all major browsers


Why XHTML?
Many pages on the internet contain "bad" HTML.

This HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it does not follow the HTML rules):


The Most Important Differences from HTML:
Document Structure
XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
XHTML Elements
XHTML elements must be properly nested
XHTML elements must always be closed
XHTML elements must be in lowercase
XHTML documents must have one root element
XHTML Attributes
Attribute names must be in lower case
Attribute values must be quoted
Attribute minimization is forbidden.


<!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory
An XHTML document must have an XHTML DOCTYPE declaration.

A complete list of all the XHTML Doctypes is found in our HTML Tags Reference.

The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document.

This example shows an XHTML document with a minimum of required tags:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<head>
  <title>Title of document</title>
</head>

<body>
  some content 
</body>
