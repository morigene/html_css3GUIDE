<!-- 
Be Smart and Future Proof.
===================
A consistent use of style makes it easier for others to understand your HTML
In the future, programs like XML readers may want to read your HTML.
USING A WELL-FORMED-"cloe to XHTML" syntax can be smart.

Always keep your code tidy, clean and well-formed.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!doctype html>  //bad
Use Lower Case Element Names
1. Mixing uppercase and loercase names is bad.
2. Developers normally use lowercase names(as in XHTML).
3. Lowercase look cleaner
4. Lowercase are easier to write.

Spaces and Equal Signs
HTML5 allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.

Bad:
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css"

Good:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Avoid Long Code Lines
When using an HTML editor, it is inconvenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.

Try to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

Blank Lines and Indentation
Do not add blank lines without a reason.

For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.

For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

Do not use unnecessary blank lines and indentation. It is not necessary to indent every element:
