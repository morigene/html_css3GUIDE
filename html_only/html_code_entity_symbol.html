<!--  Character encoding?
==============================================
 ASCII was the first character encoding standard(also called character set)  ASCII defined 128 different alphanumeric haracters that could be used on the internet: numbers(0-9), English letters(A - Z), English letters(A - Z), and some special characters like Q$+-()@<>.
==============

 -->
ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, with support for 256 different character codes.

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.

Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
